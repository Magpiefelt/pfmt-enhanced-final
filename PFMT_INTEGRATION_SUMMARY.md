# PFMT Excel Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Excel sheet upload functionality to auto-populate PFMT project data from uploaded workbooks. The implementation includes a comprehensive data extraction system that reads key financial fields from PFMT Excel files and integrates them into the monthly reporting application.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. PFMT Data Extractor Component (`PFMTDataExtractor.jsx`)
- **File Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop Excel file upload with validation
- **Excel Parsing**: Uses SheetJS (xlsx) library to read .xlsx and .xlsm files
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts key financial data from 'SP Fields' sheet:
  - Total Approved Funding (TAF) - Cell B2
  - Estimate at Completion (EAC) - Cell B6
  - Current Year Cashflow Total - Cell B4
  - Current Year Target - Cell B7
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation with business rules
- **Preview Interface**: Shows extracted data before import with comparison to current values
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file and data issues

### 2. Integration with Existing Application
- **Enhanced App.jsx**: Added PFMT state management and dialog integration
- **Updated Status Update Workflow**: "Update PFMT Data" button now opens Excel upload dialog
- **Project Data Synchronization**: Extracted data updates both local project state and global projects state
- **Audit Trail**: Tracks when PFMT data was last imported and from which file

### 3. Data Fields Extracted

#### Primary Financial Fields
- **Total Approved Funding (TAF)**: Total funding approved for the project
- **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**: Total projected cost at completion
- **Current Year Cashflow**: Sum of actual and forecast expenditures for current fiscal year
- **Current Year Target**: Approved budget target for current fiscal year

#### Calculated Variances
- **TAF vs EAC Variance**: Automatically calculated (TAF - EAC)
- **Cashflow Variance**: Automatically calculated (Current Year Target - Current Year Cashflow)

### 4. Validation and Business Rules
- **Required Field Validation**: Ensures all critical fields are present and valid
- **Business Rule Checks**: 
  - Large variance detection (>10% TAF variance, >$1M cashflow variance)
  - EAC reasonableness check (warns if EAC > 150% of TAF)
- **Data Type Validation**: Ensures numeric fields are valid numbers
- **File Format Validation**: Validates Excel file format and structure

### 5. User Experience Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Intuitive file upload interface
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on data quality
- **Data Preview**: Shows current vs. new values before import
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during file processing
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Success Confirmation**: Confirmation of successful data import
